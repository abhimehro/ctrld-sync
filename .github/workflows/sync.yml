      # PERFORMANCE: Caching pip dependencies significantly speeds up CI
      # Cache key is based on requirements.txt + pyproject.toml hashes, automatically
      # invalidating when deps change. Both files are included because pyproject.toml
      # defines the source of truth for dependencies.
      # See: https://github.com/actions/setup-python#caching-packages-dependencies
